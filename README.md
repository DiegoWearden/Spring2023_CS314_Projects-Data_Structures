## Projects

### Code Camp
An introductory project to get acclimated with Java programming. Concepts covered include variables, control structures, methods, and basic Java syntax.

### Mathematical Matrices
This individual project focuses on developing a stand-alone class for performing operations on mathematical matrices. The project strengthens understanding of class design and encapsulation.

### Name Surfer
A project that involves creating a program with multiple interacting classes and the use of ArrayLists. The program enables querying and display of trends in baby names.

### Evil Hangman
A game of hangman that utilizes data structures adeptly to mislead the player. The project highlights the use and manipulation of data structures such as Hash Maps, Tree Maps, and ArrayLists.

### Linked Lists
The focus of this individual assignment is on implementing and manipulating linked lists. Explores the creation and use of a doubly linked list, and operations involving linked lists such as adding, removing, and traversing linked lists and their time complexities.

### Recursion
An assignment digging into the concept of recursion, working on problems that are naturally solved using recursive thinking and methods.

### Anagram Solver 
This project involves creating an anagram solver. The focus is on using recursive methods and expanding the grasp on recursion, as well as highlighting the real world application of this concept.

### Implementing a Set class
This assignment explores multiple advanced concepts in Java programming. It involves creating a Set class, introducing the use of abstract classes, inheritance, interfaces, iterators, polymorphism, and strengthening knowledge of sorting, searching, and lists.

### Binary Search Trees
This project is dedicated to a deep dive into binary search trees and how they can effectively organize and access data. It sheds light on the insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal operations of binary search trees and their time complexities.

### Huffman Coding
An assignment to learn about the implementation of the Huffman Coding algorithm. This project not only reinforced our understanding of trees, especially binary trees, and their applications in data compression and bit manipulation, but we also designed and implemented our own Priority Queue from scratch to facilitate the construction of the Huffman tree.

### Graph Algorithms
The final project of the course delving into the practical application of graph theory. It involves implementing and grappling with various graph algorithms such as Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, and Dijkstra's algorithms, to solve complex programming challenges.
